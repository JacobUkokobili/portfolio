        <p>I was a Civil Engineer in my past life, now I enjoy crunching on data for a living. I'm a very outgoing, open-minded person, curious, interesting and a polyglot. In my free time, I like to go for a run, read, learn new things, take a long walk, meditate, write and listening to music. My interests are artificial intelligence, machine learning, philosophy, music, arts, tech, travel spirituality, nature, fun and adventure. Yea, that's just an outline.</p>

        <h3>Construction</h3>
        <h5>Project Engineer</h5>
        <p>In 2016, as a Project Engineer with Palladio Development Company Limited, Lagos, Nigeria, I gained valuable skills in project management, negotiation and report writing. In addition to my role as a Project Engineer, I also performed civil engineering functions; leading a team of twenty persons and executing other responsibilities attached to my role which included a review of engineering deliverables, initiating appropriate corrective actions, and the handling of the procurement and logistics process.</p>

        <h3>Interior Design</h3>
        <h5>Project Coordinator</h5>
        <p>In the second half of 2017, I joined Blue Mahogany Limited (Lagos, Nigeria), where I supervised numerous projects for companies like Carbon and Sparkle. Working with Blue Mahogany served to further consolidate my skills as a project coordinator, while providing a platform for me to learn the fundamentals and elements of interior design. Here, I spent ample time on personal development and found that I had a passion for training. I trained my colleagues on the use of MS Excel, I designed a training manual for new employees and an end-of-project report template.  The various functions I performed helped to hone my communication and speaking skills.</p>

        <h3>Data Science</h3>
        <h5>Data Sceintist Beginner</h5>
        <p>I had always wanted to explore the possibilities in the world of technology and so in February 2020, I embarked on a journey to become a data scientist. I love to unravel trends in data, visualize it and predict the future with ML algorithms. But the most satisfying part of this journey has been sharing my experience and the challenges that I have faced with the community of other beginners. I have taken a series of courses in data science and machine learning and I have also acquired some certifications to back up my knowledge.</p>
